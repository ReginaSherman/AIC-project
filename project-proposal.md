Project Proposal Worksheet

Project Description
---------------------------------------
I'm making an app for people interested in fine art. The main homescreen will display several different famous paintings. They can be clicked on to display 
more information about the specific painting. I'd like to eventually be able to search through paintings by artist, medium, year, etc.

# AIC-project

This application is a simple way for people who enjoy art to view and learn more about certain pieces. It pulls various art from the Art Institue of Chicago, allows user to click and view larger as well as see more information about that particular piece. You are also able to view pieces only from certain categories.

# Technologies Used

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, Reactstrap

# Getting Started

# Next Steps

I'd like to be able to pull data from multiple sources, have more robust filtering through categories as well as being able to filter by artist. I'd also like to add a "random" button so it will just show you a random piece of art.
